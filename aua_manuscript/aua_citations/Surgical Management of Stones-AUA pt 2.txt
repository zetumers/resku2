Surgical Management of Stones: American UrologicalAssociation/Endourological Society Guideline, PART II

22. In symptomatic patients with a totalrenal stone burden>20 mm, clinicians shouldoffer PCNL as first-line therapy. (Index Patient8) (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C)PCNL offers a higher stone-free rate than SWL orURS and is less invasive than open surgery orlaparoscopic/robotic assisted procedures. In a RCTcomparing PCNL to URS for >2 cm renal pelvicstones, the stone-free rate was higher for PCNLcompared to URS (94% versus 75%), although predominantlysemi-rigid URS was used in thisstudy.23 Furthermore, the success rate of PCNL isless dependent on stone composition, density andlocation.
